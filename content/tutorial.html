<H3>Getting Started</H3>

<p>
   Conkeror uses Emacs-style key notation.  A sequence of keys is
   separated by spaces, and key modifiers are indicated with
   single-letter prefixes, with the prefixes and the key separated by
   hyphens.  The most common prefixes are C for control, M for meta
   and alt (following the Emacs convention), and S for shift.  For
   example, the notation `C-M-t' means hold down control and meta and
   press t.
