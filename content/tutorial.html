<h1>Conkeror Tutorial</h1>

<p>You are looking at the Conkeror tutorial.  See end for copying conditions.

<h3>Welcome to Conkeror</h3>

<p>
  The first thing you need to know about Conkeror is how to read key
  notation.  Each key combination is written as a hyphen-separated
  list of modifiers and key.  The codes for the common modifiers are
  as follows: <code>C</code> means Control; <code>M</code> means Meta
  or Alt; and <code>S</code> means Shift.  Therefore the key
  combination <code>C-M-f</code> means to hold down Control and Meta
  and press <code>f</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The key to scroll down is <code>C-n</code>.  The key to scroll up is
  <code>C-p</code>
</p>

<p>
  Many commands in Conkeror are run by typing a sequence of two or
  more keys.  This is notated by writing each key combination in the
  sequence, separated by spaces.  The sequence <code>C-h t</code>
  means to press Control-h, release all keys, then press
  <code>t</code>.  <code>C-h t</code> is the key sequence to view this
  tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  The key sequence to exit conkeror is <code>C-x C-c</code>.
