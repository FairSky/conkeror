User visible changes. See ChangeLog for more details listing of
changes.

** Changes since 0.39
* fixed next/prev word bindings for text areas

* fixed save-link

* new commands save-page, save-page-as-text, save-page-complete

* Hopefully keyboard focus is fixed
Conkeror listens on the window, now, for keypresses making it that
much harder to lose keyboard focus. Hitting TAB to focus the window
and allow scrolling is still sometimes required.

** Changes since 0.37
* new keymap numberedlinks_kmap
Use this keymap to customise keybindings when selecting a numbered
link. See bindings.js for current bindings.

** Changes since 0.36
* bump version to work with firefox 2.0 

** Changes since 0.35

** Changes since 0.34
* 2 new globals
The following globals can be set to change whether numbered and image
links are visible for new buffers.

default_show_numbered_links
default_show_numbered_images

** Changes since 0.33
* new numberedlinks global toggle: global_numbered_links_mode

set this to false and you'll never see the numbered links.

* fixed firefox command

* webjumps loaded before rc file

* delicious_username has been replaced with add_delicious_webjumps ("myusername");
 
** Changes since 0.32
* new command jsconsole

** Changes since 0.30
* The bookmark listing shows bookmarks from subfolders, not just the top level bookmarks.

* double number bug fixed

* blank screen after killing a browser bug fixed

** Changes since 0.29
bug fixes only.

** Changes since 0.28
bug fixes only.

** Changes since 0.27
* bookmark-bmenu-list command takes a prefix arg
now you can open the list in a new buffer or window.

** Changes since 0.26
* -remote should work as expected

** Changes since 0.24
* splits have been removed
This was fall out from fixing a scrolling bug. I suspect splits
weren't widely used so hopefully they won't be missed. I'm open to
ways of getting them working again.

** Changes since 0.23
* new print-buffer command
* new extension command
* new renumber-links command
* asynchronous link numbering
