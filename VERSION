## This file is the only place where you have to set Conkeror's version.  The
## version is given here in the form of a specifier of three terms:
## MAJOR.MINOR.MILESTONE.  The build system will process this value to reflect
## the build target.  For release builds, the last term will be automatically
## dropped.  For non-release builds, a fourth term (build date) will be
## appended.
##

## To prepare a release, the maintainer should increment the minor version
## (second component), and set the milestone version (third component) to 0.
##

## The milestone (third component) should be incremented for any nontrivial
## change to the project source in the public repository since the last
## release.  The milestone gives developers an unambiguous way to indicate the
## relevant version of a patch or bug report.

VERSION=0.42.2
