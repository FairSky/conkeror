conkeror (0.9.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + Closes: #542252 (YouTube download broken)
  * Added alternative dependency on xulrunner-1.9.1
  * Moved from directly calling "xulrunner application.ini" to calling a
    symlinked xulrunner-stub (symlinking xulrunner-stub only works with
    Debian's xulrunner-stub, thanks Mike Hommey :-), so that xulrunner can
    decide which version of xulrunner is actually used.
  * Refreshed debian/patches/sensible-editor.diff after upstream
    whitespace changes.
  * Changed debian/rules to not use the old $CONKEROR_VERSION$ macro
    anymore.
  * Do not include the whole contrib subdirectory in the binary
    package. (Closes: #547896) Only include the xrev debugging tool for
    now.
  * A few Debian and Ubuntu webjumps have been added and enabled by
    default. (Closes: #547908)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes)

conkeror (0.9~git090624-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Based on new snapshot (tagged with debian-0.9--git090624-1)
    - Session saving support has been added, but not loaded by default
    - Theming support has been removed (native GUI theming should be used
      instead, e.g. GTK theming)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.2 (no changes)
  * Replaced deprecated dh_clean -k by dh_prep and bumped debhelper
    compatibility to 7.
  * Removed deprecated dh_desktop. May cause not immediately registered
    .desktop files on Debian Lenny.
  * Moved MPL from debian/copyright to debian/MPL to allow compression in
    the installed binary packages (as with the xulrunner-1.9 packages)

conkeror (0.9~git090223-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian packaging is now hosted in the upstream repository at
    http://repo.or.cz/w/conkeror.git:
    - Adjusted the Vcs-* headers in debian/control.
    - Changed the build id to contain username and hostname instead of
      commit id.
  * Based on new snapshot (tagged with debian-0.9--git090223-1)

      conkeror-spawn-helper -- package names remain unchanged, conflict to
      earlier versions of conkeror-spawn-process-helper
    - Links on mouse over images now shown
    - command switch -uu for universal-arg of following -f command
  * Added NEWS.Debian to list changes relevant for users.
  * Added README.source which documents how to build a Debian (source)
    package from a Git working copy.
  * Changed licencing of packaging from GPLv2 to the same licencing terms
    as Conkeror itself.
  * Updated debian/copyright to reflect current state of the project
  * man page conkeror.1 now part of upstream.
  * Added a call to dh_desktop (Thanks, Lintian 2.x!)

conkeror (0.9~git080629-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Based on new snapshot (commit
    6944096a1af033d0aa70d8b4cc19b271e0d832b1)
  * Uses now quilt for patch management, added appropriate build-deps.
  * Use sensible-editor instead of emacs by default.
  * Changed default desktop icon from "web-browser.png" to
    "browser". (Closes: #491880; fixes a desktop-file-validate warning)
  * Made M-x conkeror-version show the Debian version instead of
    '$CONKEROR_VERSION$'.
  * Remove suggestion of zile since conkeror currently can't handle
    text-mode only editors. Suggest the virtual package emacsen instead.
  * Depends now on "xulrunner (>= 1.9~) | xulrunner-1.9" instead of solely
    "xulrunner-1.9".
  * Added a lintian override for debian-watch-file-is-missing since there
    are no upstream releases to watch (yet).
