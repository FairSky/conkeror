conkeror (0.9~git090201-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Debian packaging is now hosted in the upstream repository at
    http://repo.or.cz/w/conkeror.git -- adjust the Vcs-* headers in
    debian/control.
  * Based on new snapshot (tagged with debian-0.9~git090201-1)
    - spawn-process-helper has been renamed upstream to
      conkeror-spawn-helper -- package names remain unchanged, conflict to
      earlier versions of conkeror-spawn-process-helper
    - Links on mouse over images now shown
    - command switch -uu for universal-arg of following -f command
  * Added NEWS.Debian to list changes relevant for users.
  * TODO: Documented more command-line switches in man page and --help

conkeror (0.9~git080629-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Based on new snapshot (commit
    6944096a1af033d0aa70d8b4cc19b271e0d832b1)
  * Uses now quilt for patch management, added appropriate build-deps.
  * Use sensible-editor instead of emacs by default.
  * Changed default desktop icon from "web-browser.png" to
    "browser". (Closes: #491880; fixes a desktop-file-validate warning)
  * Made M-x conkeror-version show the Debian version instead of
    '$CONKEROR_VERSION$'.
  * Remove suggestion of zile since conkeror currently can't handle
    text-mode only editors. Suggest the virtual package emacsen instead.
  * Depends now on "xulrunner (>= 1.9~) | xulrunner-1.9" instead of solely
    "xulrunner-1.9".
  * Added a lintian override for debian-watch-file-is-missing since there
    are no upstream releases to watch (yet).
